# AI_QA_PDF_Colab_Notebook
This notebook demonstrates a prototype that:

- Parses uploaded PDFs
- Embeds the content using OpenAI
- Stores it in Pinecone
- Answers questions via LangChain

The purpose of your project is to create an AI-powered system that can answer natural language questions about the contents of any uploaded PDF document. Here's what each component does and why it matters:

📌 Project Purpose Summary
Goal:
Let users upload a PDF → the system reads it → stores the content in a searchable way → users can then ask questions in natural language and get intelligent answers.

🔍 Detailed Component Breakdown
📄 Parse uploaded PDFs

Why: To extract readable text from PDF files (e.g., reports, research papers, documentation).

How: Use libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.

🧠 Embed the content using OpenAI

Why: To convert text into numerical vectors that capture meaning/context, enabling semantic search (not just keyword match).

How: Use OpenAI's embedding models like text-embedding-ada-002.

🗂️ Store in Pinecone

Why: To efficiently store and search large volumes of embedded data using vector search.

How: Pinecone acts as a high-performance vector database.

💬 Answer questions via LangChain

Why: LangChain connects everything and uses the OpenAI language model to generate answers based on relevant chunks from the PDF.

How: Combines retrieved chunks with the user’s question to generate a meaningful answer.

🧠 Real-World Use Cases:
Legal teams searching case files

Students asking questions about lecture PDFs

Researchers querying large academic papers

Enterprises building knowledge assistants over documentation
